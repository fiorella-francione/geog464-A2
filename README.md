1) Problem:
Montreal's 2030 Climate Plan includes a strategy to convert open parking lots into green spaces in an effort to plant 500 000 new trees.
2) The audience:
borough planners, environmental advisors
3) Core action
Identify and filter through open parking spaces by borough, click any point to view its address and hourly rate.

AI disclosure: Blue lane
I used the format from Lab 3 to load in my data, export the cleaned rows into a GeoJSON and the check cell. To help with the section on using geopandas to join my parking lot data with their respective boroughs, I used the built-in Copilot chat with the Auto "Balance" model. The method I used for asking the AI was first to define my dataset (boroughs.geojson) and join it with df_h (dataframe with only off-street parking rows). I also specified to the AI not to make changes to my notebook and to also include comments to each line of code so I could understand what each line did. It suggested I load the geopandas extension first, create points from my df_h and check that both datasets were in the same coordinate system. Then, it wrote the line for the join but it also wrote a line to save this join into a new GeoJSON. I removed this line because I wanted to save it to the same GeoJSON file I had created earlier. To verify the join, I counted the number of points that did not match a borough and it came up as 0. As for the presentation and behavior of the website, I asked AI to help load in a font family I found online. It also suggested a few details to make the website stand out inlcuding adding a border to the map and changing the background color, which I accepted once I knew how it worked. Some changes had to be made throughout app.js, html and style.css for the legend to show up properly. I tweaked the dimensions of the map size, text, legend to my own liking.
